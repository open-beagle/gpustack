```bash
curl -sfL https://get.gpustack.ai | sh -s -
```

### Windows

Run PowerShell as administrator (**avoid** using PowerShell ISE), then run the following command to install GPUStack:

```powershell

```

### Other Installation Methods

For manual installation, docker installation or detailed configuration options, please refer to the [Installation Documentation](installation/installation-script.md).

## Getting Started

1. Run and chat with the **llama3.2** model:

```bash
gpustack chat llama3.2 "tell me a joke."
```

2. Open `http://myserver` in the browser to access the GPUStack UI. Log in to GPUStack with username `admin` and the default password. You can run the following command to get the password for the default setup:

**Linux or MacOS**

```bash
cat /var/lib/gpustack/initial_admin_password
```

**Windows**

Get-Content -Path "$env:APPDATA\gpustack\initial_admin_password" -Raw

4. Click `API Keys` in the navigation menu, then click the `New API Key` button.

5. Fill in the `Name` and click the `Save` button.

6. Copy the generated API key and save it somewhere safe. Please note that you can only see it once on creation.

7. Now you can use the API key to access the OpenAI-compatible API. For example, use curl as the following:

```bash
export GPUSTACK_API_KEY=myapikey
curl http://myserver/v1-openai/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GPUSTACK_API_KEY" \
  -d '{

        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```
